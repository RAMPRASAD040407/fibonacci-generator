# fibonacci-generator
The generator function uses Python‚Äôs yield keyword to lazily return the next Fibonacci number in the sequence each time it is called.

Fibonacci Sequence:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
Each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

üì¶ Requirements
Python 3.x
No external libraries are needed.

def fibonacci_generator():
    first_number = 0
    second_number = 1
    while True:
        yield first_number
        next_number = first_number + second_number
        first_number = second_number
        second_number = next_number
Initializes the first two numbers: 0 and 1

Uses yield to return values one at a time

Updates the numbers on each iteration to generate the next in the sequence

‚úÖ Benefits of Using a Generator
Memory efficient: Doesn't store the entire sequence

Scalable: Can be used to generate as many numbers as needed

Simple & clean syntax
